Declare an enum called GameMode with states Easy, Medium, and Hard. Assign specific number values to each state (Easy = 10, Medium = 25, Hard = 30).

Initialize a variable of type GameMode to Medium.

Use a switch statement to print different messages depending on the selected game mode. Include the difficulty value associated with each mode in the output message.

Sample Output:
Selected mode: Medium
Good luck! The enemies will be 25 times more than easy challenging!
